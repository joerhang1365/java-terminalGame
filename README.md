# TerminalGame-Java
This is my first game made in Java. It was created in a couple weeks and includes some emotions I was dealing with at the time. Not a fun game I would say but a story game. I am pretty sure there are terrible performance issues with my project and some things are broken but what ever. Play it if you please.
